# Anomaly_Detection - Unsupervised and Semi-Supervised Methods

Objective - To detect anomalies using unsupervised and semi-supervised methods  

Although supervised techniques can be used to detect anomalies, availability of labeled data for training/validation of models is usually a major issue in practical situations.  

Data can be downloaded from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Polish+companies+bankruptcy+data (1-year data)  
The data contains financial rates from 1st year of the forecasting period and corresponding class label that indicates bankruptcy status after 5 years.
